#ModId definition file for Wolfenstein 3D for PC-98, Imagineer release
#98GRAPH.WL6
#
#NOTES:
# - GRSTARTS was effectively (re)defined to 4 for the PC-98 port.
# - 98HEAD.WL6 ends with 4 more zero-bytes (after 98GRAPH.WL6 filesize).
# - 98GRAPH.WL6 contains just unmasked fonts and graphics. That's all.
# - The bitmaps header chunk is NOT compressed, and the same applies
# to the very first ten bitmaps (used in HelpScreens).
# - In addition, none of above ten bitmaps' chunks begins with 4 bytes
# telling their sizes; They basically share common hardcoded dimensions
# of 320x200 pixels.
# - Furthermore, these 10 bitmaps are LINEAR (non-planar) 8-bpp bitmaps.
# - Finally, a few of the dimensions in the bitmaps header chunk
# are WRONG. This covers bitmaps no. 130-135 (HUD digits 4-9), which
# share the common dimensions of 8x16 (no problem with digits 0-3),
# as well as bitmaps no. 136-142 (most HUD face pics) with the
# dimensions of 24x32. Maybe CAL_ExpandGrChunk was modified
# to take these into account.
#
# In general, it does look like GFXV_WJ6.H was used as a base,
# although some of the last few bitmap chunks are missing.
# 8x8 tiles, ERRORSCREEN and demos are also absent.
#
# Maybe 98HEAD.WL6 in ignored in-game? Otherwise, it's just partially used.
